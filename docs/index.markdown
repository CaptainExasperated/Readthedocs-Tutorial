MesoHOPS is an open-source package that uses a formally exact trajectory based approach to solve for the time evolution of open quantum systems coupled to non-Markovian thermal environments. MesoHOPS extends the Hierarchy Of Pure States (HOPS) formalism to enable tractable HOPS calculations for large systems. This is done through the adaptive Hierarchy of Pure States (adHOPS), which leverages the dynamic localization present in the wave functions to construct an adaptive basis by identifying occupied state and auxiliary basis members and constructing a time-evolving reduced basis. Alongside adHOPS, the MesoHOPS library also offers... ELABORATE ON NOISE, CONVERGENCE, ETC MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT PREFORMANCE?


<h2> About Us </h2>

Led by Dr. Doran I. G. B(ennett) Raccah, the MesoScience Lab combines theoretical chemistry, biology, physics, and applied mathematics in order to discover the principles governing charge and energy transport in molecular materials. In particular, we are focusing on developing new theoretical and computational tools to simulate photosynthetic membranes and molecular semiconductors.

<h2> Installation </h2>

There are certain prerequisites before installing MesoHOPS:
* Python >= VERSION_NUM

To download the MesoHOPS library, first use a terminal to navigate to where the library will be stored on your computer. Next, type these lines:
```
git clone https://github.com/digbennett/pyhops.git
cd pyhops
``` 

Please see our Quickstart page to see how to run your first calculation.
